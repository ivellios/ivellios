### Howdy 👋

My name is Janusz [ IPA: /ˈjã.nuʃ/ ], but I go by the nickname _Ivellios_ [ IPA: /'ivɛljɔs/ ].

_ἔοικα γοῦν τούτου γε σμικρῷ τινι αὐτῷ τούτῳ σοφώτερος εἶναι, ὅτι ἃ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι_ -- Plato, Apology 21d.

_Seniority is not about knowledge, but wisdom!_ -- My brain at some point of life

- 📎 **A glue to the team.** I don't believe great leadership requires great tech knowledge. That is reserved for experts. I mix my tech knowledge with soft skills to influence people on the team, support them, and bring better projects to life. I know how to translate technical language to "human" and vice versa.
- ⚙️ Love **automation** and work on improving **DevEx** wherever I show up 🤓 Give me a new CI workflow idea and I am all ears 😉
- 💪 **My areas of interest:** web, automation, architecture, clean code, security, infrastructure, and supporting people
- 💻 **My main stack:** _Python, Django, Pytest, AWS, Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Terragrunt, GitHub Actions, Bash, JS, and more!_

- 🎤 I give some talk on technology once in a while (the last at [PyConPL 2023](https://pl.pycon.org/2023/agenda/))
- 📆 Organizing [DevOps Days Kraków](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-krakow/) and [DevOps Days Warsaw](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-warsaw/) - I host the conference, Open Spaces, and Ignite talks and 🥰 it!
- 🤸 I train [Acro Yoga in Kraków](https://www.facebook.com/groups/239468339510760)
- 💬 Ask me about **Role-Playing Games** and you risk me never shutting up 😁 🎲 

- 🌱 Currently learning [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
- 🤔 Always happy to accept contribution for [D&D Organized Play Krakow service](https://github.com/dnd-al-krk/)
